It is targeted to the raspberry-pi.\n\nIt is heavily inspired in [node-sdl](https://github.com/creationix/node-sdl) and [openvg](https://github.com/ajstarks/openvg).\n\nTested on node 0.8, 0.10 and 0.11.\n\n## 0. Installation\n\nJust install via npm:\n\n    npm install openvg\n\n## 1. Usage\n\nThis library makes a 1:1 mapping between OpenVG 1.1 (as currently bundled on raspian) and JS (via node.js/v8 bindings).\n\n### Differences from the OpenVG APIs.\n\nAll array based APIs are implemented via JS typed arrays. As such, length and offsets are supposed to be handled by the typed array API.\n\nDue to exceptional slowness of typed array creation (should be avoided at all costs either in node and in browser code), even when using [subarray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays/Int8Array), the APIs that receive typed arrays as parameters (setXxxFV, setXxxIV, etc.) also present OL (Offset + Length) or O (Offset) variants.\n\n### Commonalities with the OpenVG APIs.\n\nCurrently, handles to OpenVG resources aren't wrapped in JS/C++ objects.\nFor this reason, special care must be taken to ensure propper destruction of these\nobjects, as they wont be reclaimed by the garbage collector.\nThis may be seen as a bonus since this explicit resource management may help improve\nperformance, esp. in the scenario where this library is supposed to be used.\n\nPS: There are plans to support this kind of wrapping in the future.\n\n### Examples\n\nThis library was created as a base for [openvg-canvas](https://github.com/luismreis/node-openvg-canvas), but can be used standalone.\n\nAlso, check the [examples directory](https://github.com/luismreis/node-openvg/tree/master/examples).\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012, 2013 Luis Reis\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
